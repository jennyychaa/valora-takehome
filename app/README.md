# homefeed-app

This starter project was created with React + Typescript + Vite and can be used for the front end of the homefeed assignment. It includes a landing page which displays the response of the endpoint `http://localhost:3000/example`. You can customise this project to display a homefeed using your own endpoint.

To get started, fork this repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. You can then run `yarn dev` to start the server on port number `5173`. Then you can visit `http://localhost:5173/` to see the example landing page. Start your backend server in a different window so that the front end can fetch the data from the endpoint.

To run unit tests, run `yarn test`.

There are also a few other tools included that could help you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), configured with [@valora/eslint-config-typescript](https://github.com/valora-inc/eslint-config-typescript)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for auto-formatting
