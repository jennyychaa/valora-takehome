# Wallet Transaction History Application

## Project Objective

This is a user-friendly proof-of-concept application designed for novice cryptocurrency enthusiasts (e.g. an elderly family member) to effortlessly understand their transaction history on Ethereum. The application should present the transaction history associated with a given wallet address straightforwardly and intuitively, akin to traditional bank transaction records. Despite the abundance of blockchain explorers available, their tendency to overwhelm users with excessive data often complicates the understanding of transactions. This project is an opportunity to harness available data sources and services to craft a more accessible and engaging user experience for a blockchain-novice audience.
