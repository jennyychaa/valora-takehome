# Wallet Transaction History Application

## Project Objective

This is a user-friendly proof-of-concept application designed for novice cryptocurrency enthusiasts (e.g. an elderly family member) to effortlessly understand their transaction history on Ethereum. The application should present the transaction history associated with a given wallet address straightforwardly and intuitively, akin to traditional bank transaction records. Despite the abundance of blockchain explorers available, their tendency to overwhelm users with excessive data often complicates the understanding of transactions. This project is an opportunity to harness available data sources and services to craft a more accessible and engaging user experience for a blockchain-novice audience.

# homefeed-app

This starter project was created with React + Typescript + Vite and can be used for the front end of the homefeed assignment. It includes a landing page which displays the response of the endpoint `http://localhost:3000/example`. You can customise this project to display a homefeed using your own endpoint.

To get started, fork this repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. You can then run `yarn dev` to start the server on port number `5173`. Then you can visit `http://localhost:5173/` to see the example landing page. Start your backend server in a different window so that the front end can fetch the data from the endpoint.

To run unit tests, run `yarn test`.
