# homefeed-server

This starter project uses the Express framework and can be used for the backend of the homefeed assignment. It includes a server with an `/example` endpoint that sends a simple response. You can add more endpoints to this server to implement the backend of the homefeed assignment.

To get started, fork this repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. You can then run `yarn start` to start the server on port number `3000`. Then you can visit `http://localhost:3000/example` to see the example response. To start the server on a different port number, use `PORT=XXXX yarn start`.

To run unit tests, run `yarn test`.
